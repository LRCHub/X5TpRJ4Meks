[00:00.72] Broke up bond, said you regret it
[00:04.61] I took you back so we could mend it
[00:08.50] Said you're sorry for the damage
[00:11.57] And you'll pick up the pieces
[00:11.96] Put out puzzle back together
[00:25.96] 
[00:15.54] There's a storm inside, lightin' up my mind
[00:18.72] Oh, ya did me wrong, but ya feel so right
[00:22.97] There's a voice inside, tryna change my mind
[00:26.51] Yeah, ya did me wrong, but
[00:29.02] Oh, you make me, oh you make me
[00:44.52] 
[00:31.04] Feel so alive, like ridin' giant waves
[00:34.64] Through our paradise like kissin' in the rain
[00:38.02] Yes, when I'm with you, no, I can't deny
[00:39.96] Your love got me hooked and I'm high tonight
[00:41.99] I feel so alive
[00:43.83] Oh, you make me, oh you make-
[01:00.46] Oh, you make me-
[01:08.46] 
[01:17.36] Feelin' guarded, I can't help it
[01:20.70] I'm a little scared, but is that selfish?
[01:24.33] 'Cause if all is fair, in love and war then
[01:27.86] Let's call it even, there's no time for second guessin'
[01:55.36] 
[01:31.27] There's a storm inside lightin' up my mind
[01:35.06] Oh, ya did me wrong, but ya feel so right
[01:38.76] There's a voice inside, tryna change my mind
[01:42.50] Yeah, ya did me wrong, but
[01:45.07] Oh, you make me, oh you make me
[02:00.57] 
[01:46.94] Feel so alive like ridin' giant waves
[01:50.51] Through our paradise like kissin' in the rain
[01:54.48] Yes, when I'm with you, no, I can't deny
[01:56.15] Your love got me hooked and I'm high tonight
[01:58.03] I feel so alive
[02:00.00] Oh, you make me, oh you make-
[02:16.35] Oh, you make me-
